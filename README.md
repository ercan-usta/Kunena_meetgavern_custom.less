# Kunena_meetgavern_custom.less

## Introduction
With the introduction of the new bootstrapped Crypsis template and Kunena 4.x there are some issues with the bootstrap version that is implemented and used by the Joomla template Meet_Gavern. This custom.less file will fix the css bootstrap issues and will (for Kunena pages) replace font-awesome font-icons with IcoMoon font-icons (These are already installed as part of Joomla's default template Protostar).

## Download and installation
You can download the zip file from github. unzip it and copy / upload or ftp the custom.less file to your website's ./components/com_kunena/template/crypsis/less directory. That is it :)

## Configuration
No configuration necessary. However: if you would like to adjust the code, you can either edit the custom.less file or use the edit functionality in the Kunena back-end component.

Feel free to update and share your improvements!
